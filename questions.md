# PythonWebsiteForCrypto


## Questions
* Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
* Answer: Due to limited time I was not able to find an free API for retreving live Bid and Ask prices for crypto currencies. So, I did not do that part of this assignment.
* Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
* Answer: No
* If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
* Answer: First of all I would not use a micro framework like Flask because it has some limited cappacitys and switch to Django if I am creating a website in Python.
* What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
* Answer: I would have found an API that I can retrevie Bid/Ask prices and compare them and show which exchange would be better for buying and selling the crypto currency.
